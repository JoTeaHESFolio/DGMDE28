        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          From an early age, my fascination with farming was kindled by my
          father's deep-rooted connection to agriculture. Raised among chickens
          in Connecticut, he carried this affinity with him to Florida. He
          embarked on a journey of cultivating what he endearingly termed a
          'Gentleman's Farm,' first in Florida and then in Northeastern
          Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my pre-teen years, I eagerly embraced this heritage, learning
          to operate and maintain tractors as I carefully navigated the upper
          fields, avoiding the tender tree saplings. Alongside my mother, I
          honed my skills in tending to our one-acre food production
          field—gardening, harvesting, and preserving our bountiful produce. I
          even raised prize-winning pheasants, unwittingly contributing plump,
          wholesome fowl to holiday tables across seveal neighboring farms
          during Thanksgiving and Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I voraciously delved into books on herbs and foraging, worked at
          rejuvenating acres of wildflowers and several long-forgotten heritage
          rose bushes and peonies neglected by previous gardeners.
        </p>
        <p>
          My family would return to Florida each fall, where I attended high
          school. I took up Latin to enrich my botanical vocabulary,
          participated in science fairs, and delved into the arts. My father's
          guidance in developing science fair projects led me down a path that
          embraced alternate energy sources, unknowingly sowing the seeds of
          environmentalism. By the time I graduated, I was well-versed in solar
          and hydrogen energy systems. And then like more teens who grow up on
          farms, I left it all behind to pursue a different career.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the next 25 years, I pursued studies and practiced in the arts and
          humanities while maintaining a simple kitchen garden. It wasn't until
          the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew devastated my community that I
          returned to farming with renewed purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I witnessed the vulnerabilities in our food distribution systems
          during the pandemic, my commitment to sustainable practices deepened.
          This led me to return to college where I explored subjects ranging
          from religion and war to sustainable practices theory and nutrition. I
          went "all-in" despite being fully virtual — participating in
          hack-a-thons with the US Census Department and developing a business
          in the Harvard i-lab during my undergraduate studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between academic terms, I dedicated myself to continuous learning,
          enrolling in MOOCs and certificate programs focused on climate change
          and regenerative practices. I even began pursuing an MS didactic
          nutrition program with the goal of becoming a Registered Dietary
          Nutritionist (RDN).
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I am finishing my graduate degree at Harvard in Digital Media
          Design and serving as an Americorps VISTA with Forsyth Farmers'
          Market. I utilize the knowledge attained in my studies, and the
          practical experience from my earlier career, to contribute to
          addressing food equity and security issues in my community. One of my
          weekly responsibilities is maintaining the organization website—the
          <a href="https://forsythfarmersmarket.com/" target="_blank"
            >Forsyth Farmer's Market</a
          >, hosted by Square Space. In the next five years, I aspire to pursue
          a Ph.D. While Harvard University is my top choice, I am also exploring
          opportunities at Tufts' University in their Agriculture, Food, and
          Environment program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, my vision extends beyond Earth's borders. I aspire to
          innovate in food systems redesign and develop sustainable food
          cultivation practices for off-planet exploration—but not for any of
          Elon Musk's ventures. In finding creative ways to address the
          challenges of nourishing humans for long-haul travel beyond our
          planet, we can find solutions that drive meaningful changes in food
          systems design and distribution here on Earth. Food, after all, is a
          fundamental human right, and I am dedicated to being an agent of
          change, working towards equity—or ensuring healthy, nutrient-dense,
          whole foods for EVERYONE—while safeguarding our planet.

      <section id="Background">
        <h2>Background in Web and Software Development</h2>
        <p>I grew up with a father who coded—and was legally blind.</p>
        <p>
          Yes, the same father who farmed—that was his hobby. His profession was
          mechanical engineering—he was a 'brilliant mind' type, without a
          college degree. He dabbled in everything. So, he showed me basic C,
          C++, COBOL, and Fortran... shockingly, I remember none of it! Sure, I
          can look at a sample of code and fairly well identify it. However, I
          am fairly well the CompSci equivalent of a 'Beauty School Drop Out!'
        </p>
        <p>
          My ADHD and compounded dyslexic issues got the better of me in
          school... and still presents a challenge, particularly with scripting
          language. I manage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a list of proficiencies. I am most comfortable with
          Python—but could not tell you why. And I am literate and functional in
          all listed languages, though not really practiced in all of them
          (except JS—I just suck at JS!). I am familiar with React, but I do not
          yet feel comfortable or competent enough to list it on my resume.
        </p>
        <div class="half">
          <h3>Languages - in order of preference</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS3</li>
            <li>R</li>
            <li>Scratch</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>JS or JavaScript</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          I have some exposure to Wolfram, and I am working on teaching myself
          through their website. I also have experience with JSON. Two classes I
          took with Professor Mikhak provided exposure to React, but I did not
          work with it for my final project, opting for the 'no code' work
          product.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to my web development experience, I have some basic projects
          completed for classes in Scratch and HTML. My JS project with an API
          call for my last class was a flop. My preference is to work with
          no-code options—I prefer WIX and Notion; I also like what Canva is
          doing. I have also worked in Framer, and as I mentioned in my bio, I
          work with Square Space too, but I am not wild about it. One of my
          points of pride—and that which keeps me interested in coding— was work
          on a team project in an AI and Robotics course that created a program
          to analyze the condition (specifically, the colors in a fruit) to
          determine its level of 'ripeness.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I am not confident as a 'coder.' I understand it takes
          practice. And while I will continue to work at building my skills, I
          know that I will be better at assisting others in assessing code and
          developing a project. I am a 'big picture' person, and I excel at
          scoping, planning out the work, and ensuring that jobs are completed
          on time and on budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose to step into this course to help improve my skills and
          confidence with both coding and web design, and especially coding in
          JS and React.

        <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
        <p>
          I am a poor college student, working at a government program—which may
          or may not be cancelled by the Trump Administration—so my budget is
          tight. When I can afford to dine out, I like to eat at Cancun Mexican
          Restaurant in Savannah, GA. I love their food, and the atmosphere is
          great. Hopefully, the staff will not be deported under the new
          administration.
