# Jody's React Wordgame (No JSX)

This project is a React-based Wordle-style game that calculates and displays results for three hardcoded guesses against the answer "moody."

## Reflection

Which seems better for creating the elements of the app: JavaScript alone or JavaScript with React?

At first, I was apprehensive about this project. I hadn’t fully read the assignment during the lecture and initially believed I’d need to install JSX and NPM, which made me incredibly anxious. While I have limited experience with React—primarily through modifying Notion templates and working with the Notion API—I’ve had frustrating experiences with NPM and calling the DOM that really shook my confidence.

However, building this project using React DOM (without JSX) was a game-changer. It not only gave me a stronger grasp of components and how React operates, but it also helped me rebuild my confidence in using a package successfully alongside JavaScript. I was honestly awestruck by how quickly I was able to relayout my project and how organized the file structure became. My React-based code felt cleaner, more compact, and far easier to understand than past efforts.

I was so overanxious going into this that I made an excessive amount of notes—at one point I even had to pinch myself to be sure I wasn’t dreaming. But by the end, I felt proud of what I built.

So, my vote is clear: using JavaScript with React felt significantly better for creating the elements of this app.
